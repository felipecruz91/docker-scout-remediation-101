In this challenge, you will need to scan an image for vulnerabilities using [Docker Scout](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-scout/),
identify the most severe ones, and produce a new version of the image with fewer vulnerabilities in it.

## Prerequisites

Docker Scout expects your Docker installation to be authenticated with Docker Hub.
You can log in using the `docker login` command with a **test Docker Hub account** and a limited-scope access token (`Public Repo Read-only`) that you [can easily generate specifically for this challenge](https://hub.docker.com).
**Usage of personal and especially production Docker Hub accounts is strongly discouraged.**

kind: warning

When you're done with the challenge, don't forget to log out with `docker logout`.
Or simply terminate the playground VM ðŸ˜‰

:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_docker_login
---
#active
Waiting for `docker login` to complete...

#completed
Yay! You've logged in ðŸŽ‰ Now you can use Docker Scout to scan images.
::

## Build the image
The directory `~/scout-demo-service` contains a vulnerable Node.js application that you can use to follow along.
Move into the directory and build the image locally with the tag `scout-demo:v1`.

:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_image_v1

#active
Waiting for `scout-demo:v1` image to be built...

#completed
Yay! The `scout-demo:v1` container image was built ðŸŽ‰
::

## Analyze image vulnerabilities

After building the image, use the `docker scout` CLI command to see vulnerabilities detected by Docker Scout.
This challenge uses a vulnerable version of Express and an outdated base image.

::hint-box

:summary: Hint 1
---

It's an easy one - `docker scout cves --help` is your friend.
::

::hint-box
---
:summary: Hint 2
---

You can narrow down the results by filtering by package name with `docker scout cves scout-demo:v1 --only-package express`
::


## Fix application vulnerabilities

Can you rebuild the image using a slimmer base image and upgrading your `package.json` dependencies on the way so that the new image has fewer vulnerabilities?

1. Use a slimmer or a most recent version of the current base image that includes fewer vulnerabilities.
2. Update the underlying vulnerable express version to a specific version or later.
3. Build a new image with name `scout-demo:v2`.

::simple-task

:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_image_v2

#active
Waiting for `scout-demo:v2` image to be built...

#completed
Yay! The `scout-demo:v2` image has fewer vulnerabilities than the original ðŸŽ‰
::

::hint-box
---
:summary: Hint 3
---

Use a more recent version of the base image, such as:

```
- FROM alpine:3.14
+ FROM alpine:3.19
```
::

::hint-box
---
:summary: Hint 4
---

Update the `package.json` file with the new `express` version.

```
   "dependencies": {
-    "express": "4.17.1"
+    "express": "4.17.3"
   }
```
::

## Analyze the new image

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!
If you analyze the new image for CVEs again, you'll see that several vulnerabilities have been fixed.

from third-party integrations, to policy customization,
and runtime environment monitoring in real-time.
